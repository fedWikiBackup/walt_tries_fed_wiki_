I wonder if the bells will ring out and shine the light upon what the delta brings. I have fears, and I have worries, but in sleep, I find my mind buried in that which is almost and alright. I find things are better when mostly watertight. I am deluded by the sight of sights upon my telephone. They scrape reality from my gray matter - they eat away at the neurons and dendrites hovering above my the weight of my body."
