See also, internet-based pornography). If we have a basis for preventing young children from mainlining heroin (and most other drugs - and \"obscenity\"), perhaps we (as a society) should take more seriously the threat of the toddler with an iPad. But, the First Amendment protects this \"speech\" even though it is pretty basic psychological manipulation (and very similar to a drug in effect). But, the thought of this federal government regulating speech is terrifying. So I think it (speech) is something that should only be regulated at the local level."
