A pioneer in both design patterns and extreme programming, he started programming the software WikiWikiWeb in 1994 and installed it on the website of his software consultancy, Cunningham & Cunningham (commonly known by its domain name, c2.com), on March 25, 1995, as an add-on to the Portland Pattern Repository. He is one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham wikipedia]"
