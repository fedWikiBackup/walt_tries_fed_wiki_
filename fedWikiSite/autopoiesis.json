      "text": "The term \"autopoiesis\" (from Greek αὐτo- (auto-), meaning 'self', and ποίησις (poiesis), meaning 'creation, production') refers to a system capable of reproducing and maintaining itself. The term was introduced in 1972 by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to define the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells. Since then the concept has been also applied to the fields of systems theory and sociology - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis wikipedia]"

This was a word without a history, a word that could directly mean what takes place in the dynamics of the autonomy proper to living systems."

When we refer to our interactions with a concrete autopoietic system, however, we project this system on the space of our manipulations and make a description of this projection."
