      "text": "The emotion paradox is as follows. People have vivid and intense experiences of emotion in day-to-day life: they report seeing emotions like \"anger\", \"sadness\", and \"happiness\" in others, and they report experiencing \"anger\", \"sadness\" and so on themselves. Nevertheless, psychophysiological and neuroscientific evidence has failed to yield consistent support for the existence of such discrete categories of experience. Instead, the empirical evidence suggests that what exists in the brain and body is affect, and emotions are constructed by multiple brain networks working in tandem."

      "text": "Despite this evidence, most other theories of emotion assume that emotions are genetically endowed, not learned, and are produced by dedicated circuits in the brain: an anger circuit, a fear circuit, and so on. This point of view is very much in line with common-sense conceptions of emotion. The theory of constructed emotion calls this assumption into question. It suggests that these emotions (often called \"basic emotions\") are not biologically hardwired, but instead are phenomena that emerge in consciousness \"in the moment\" from more fundamental ingredients."
