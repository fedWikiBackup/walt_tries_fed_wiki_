Ornament and it's place in construction and the ornamental quality of nature. \n2. Taproot skyscrapers and tiny farms. \n3. The idea of. Natural, naturalized, and invasive species. \n\n\nI also saw a Rothko I love, reminded me of the emotional qualities of color. \n\nThinking back on StormKing, I wonder what color I will paint the steel for the deck.
