Melba was the wife of a judge. Her neuroticism was of a specific variety - and it exhilarated Walter. Her careful care for her many plants would send shivers down Walter's spine. Deep into his sensing body he would feel her care and love grasping onto life. Her mother abandoned her. Her father raised her as a farm hand tomboy. She quickly discovered she was not a tomboy - instead a delicate germanic princess of the very blonde haired blue-eyed variety. Again, she was a discerning drinker. "
