      "text": "Shermer was once a fundamentalist Christian, but ceased to believe in the existence of God during his graduate studies. He accepts the labels agnostic, nontheist, atheist and others. He has expressed reservations about such labels for his lack of belief in a God, however, as he sees them being used in the service of \"pigeonholing\", and prefers to simply be called a skeptic. He also describes himself as an advocate for humanist philosophy as well as the science of morality."
